The shape and weight of the buffalo are two characteristics that set them apart. They are, in fact, North Americaâ€™s largest animal. Bulls can weigh up to 2,000 pounds and measure up to 12 feet long and 6 feet tall. The large hump on top of their heads comprises robust, powerful muscles aiding snow removal. The hump also helps limit neck and head rotation, as their heads can weigh up to 75 pounds.
