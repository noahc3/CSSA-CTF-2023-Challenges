## Description

Ha! I have figured out a way to make the caesar cipher secure! I have added more characters by allowing numbers, and letters as well. Humans can't spell anything other than in base 26 which is much less impressive than base 2.

## Hints

the alphabet is abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789

## Solution

Simple caeser cipher but the alphabet is abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789. Brute force it, until one looks like words. Since this is so easy it could be manually brute forced.
