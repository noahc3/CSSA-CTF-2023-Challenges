## Description

Little known fact about AI is that we don't have to use any specific language. So I have now decided to scramble the entire alphabet because why not. Not only that but I added numbers to the alphabet. Good luck trying to unscramble this.

## Hints

Spaces are _'s
The alphabet is abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789

## Solution

Simple substitution cipher but the alphabet is abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789. Brute force it, until one looks like words. Likely would have to use an external tool (example: https://gitlab.com/guballa/SubstitutionBreaker)

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789

## Flag
