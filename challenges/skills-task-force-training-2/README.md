## Description

Great work Agent! Another skill you'll need is the ability to convert between number bases and encodings. We have a server setup with some problems for you to try to get the hang of things:

Connect with ncat:

`ncat task-force-training-2.ctf.umanitobacssa.ca 10001`

or with netcat:

`nc task-force-training-2.ctf.umanitobacssa.ca 10001`

Good luck Agent!

## Solution

Connect to the server, answer the base encoding problems, and decode the base64 flag.
