## Description

The AI's messages are a little more hidden now, but there should still be something helpful hidden in them. What can you find in these messages we intercepted?

## Solution
Similar to packet search 1 but the flag is """encrypted""" (i.e. in hex instead of plaintext) and spread across multiple messages, which are numbered.

## Flag
`cssactf{sp1cy_r080t_g0$$1p}`
