## Description
We recovered this file from deep within the AI's database. It's...the CSSA logo? Hopefully it's not planning to use the CSSA logo for one of its plots... Sometimes files contain more than what they seem.

## Hints
- May require 3rd party software on Windows.

## Solution
The image can be unzipped in the command line to reveal a text file containing the flag.

Note: Windows Explorer cannot extract these files. Either install WinRAR/7zip, or truncate the file bytes to remove the PNG data. No issues on Mac or Ubuntu.

## Flag
`cssactf{G00$3_TR34SUREZ}`
