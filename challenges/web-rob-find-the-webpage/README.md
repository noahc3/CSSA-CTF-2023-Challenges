## Description
Rob swears that the AI is messing with him again. He was able to login to the website to grade the assingments those loud fourth years were badgering him for. It seems like he can't seem to find the page that he uses to grade that AI must have hidden the button to access the page. Rob thinks the page is called viewGrades

## Solution
Send a get Request to the website to get back the webpage.
